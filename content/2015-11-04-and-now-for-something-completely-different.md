I am excited to share that in a few months I will leave my
'traditional' academic position and will start a new chapter in my
professional life! During my time as a researcher, it has become clear
that what I enjoy most is finding new ways to do science, developing robust
and re-usable software, and helping and teaching others to do so. Throughout
my projects, I have constantly tried to promote good research and software
practices (including [reproducible research](https://github.com/hyperion-rt/paper-galaxy-rt-model)), and create tools that could be
used by others and are applicable beyond my specific area of research. In the last few years, I
have also been incredibly lucky to have been involved as one of the co-ordinators
and lead developers of the [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) project. My goal
is now to transform my passion for scientific software into a full-time job,
rather than fitting it in between all the usual responsabilities of a traditional
academic job.

In January, I will therefore start working full time as a freelance scientific
software and data analysis consultant. One of the projects I hope to work on, in collaboration with the [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu/) and the [Seamless Astronomy](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/seamlessastronomy/home)
group at Harvard, will be [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org), a Python package for linked
multi-dimensional data exploration (which [Chris Beaumont](http://chrisbeaumont.org/) was the lead developer for until recently). This is a
particularly exciting project in that it has users and applications in a
variety of fields, including astronomy, biology, and medical sciences (as well
as outside of science), and therefore has a lot of potential for
interdisciplinary impact (you can learn more about Glue by watching
Chris' excellent [talk at SciPy 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47LNpvDlKUk)). I hope to also
become involved in other projects, and will continue to provide
training workshops for Python and scientific computing.

I will of course remain involved in the development of many of the
Python packages I have worked on in the last few years. In particular, I will
continue to help with the coordination of the [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) project, and will continue to support many
smaller Python packages that I have developed or co-developed over the years
(such as [APLpy](http://aplpy.github.io),
[WCSAxes](http://wcsaxes.readthedocs.org),
[astrodendro](http://www.dendrograms.org), and many more).

Over the next couple of months, I will be wrapping up existing research
projects. After this, I will no longer invest a significant amount
of time into projects from a research point of view, but will of course be
open to opportunities to contribute to projects as a consultant on matters
relating to software development and data analysis. I will continue
to support the [Hyperion](http://www.hyperion-rt.org/) radiative
transfer package and will be happy to help anyone interested in contributing
new features. I would love for more developers to get involved in this
project, so please get in touch if you are interested in helping!

I have many thoughts about the future of software in Astronomy and in
particular about the lack of stable academic career paths for people
interested in *research* software development (as opposed to telescope and
instrumentation-related software development, which is at least supported by
some institutes and/or projects, although not enough), but that is a
discussion I will save for another time. For now, suffice to say that any
change in this respect cannot happen fast enough from my point of view, and I
am very much looking forward to continuing to try and impact the way Science
is done, from outside the traditionally followed path.
