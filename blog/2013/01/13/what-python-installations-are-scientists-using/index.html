  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in November 2012, I
<a href="https://twitter.com/astrofrog/status/269743084215103488">asked</a> Python
users in Science to fill out a survey to find out what <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.numpy.org">Numpy</a>, and
<a href="http://www.scipy.org">Scipy</a> versions they were using, and how they maintain their installation. My motivation for this was to collect quantitative
information to inform discussions amongst developers regarding which versions
to support, because those discussions are usually based only on guessing and
personal experience. In particular, there has been some discussion in the
<a href="http://www.astropy.org">Astropy</a> project regarding whether we should drop
support for Numpy 1.4, but we had no quantitative information about whether
this would affect many users (which motivated this study).</p>
<p>In this post, I'll give an overview of the results, as well as access to the
(anonymized) raw data. First, I should mention that given my area of research
and networks, the only community I obtained significant data are Astronomers,
so the results I present here only include these (though I also provide the
raw data for the remaining users for anyone interested).</p>


<p>Before I show the results, I just want to make it clear that I am not claiming
that the results are a true sampling of Python user levels. I advertised the
poll via Twitter, a couple of Python mailing lists, and the Facebook group for
Astronomers. The survey was announced on different days on Twitter and
Facebook, so there may be some useful information about the typical Python
installations of Twitter vs Facebook users buried in the data that I won't
cover here. If anyone is interested about when the announcements were made, to
correlate with response peaks in the data, please let me know!</p>
<p>With that out of the way... let's look at the results!</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>First, some general stats - there were 313 responses in total, of which 244
were related to Astronomy (where I use the term in the broadest sense,
including solar physics, planetary science, astrophysics, and cosmology). The
responses were recorded between November 17th 2012 and December 2nd 2012 (at
which point the rate of responses had gone down to less than one a day).</p>
<h2>Python Versions</h2>
<p><img alt="python versions" src="http://astrofrog.github.com/images/python_versions.png" /></p>
<p>As shown above, an overwhelming 80% of Astronomers use Python 2.7, and almost
15% use Python 2.6. Almost no-one uses Python 3.x for production work yet,
which is not surprising, given that at the time of the poll there were not
stable versions for all the crucial packages in a scientific Python stack (in
particular, Matplotlib only released their first Python 3.x compatible release
in December). It will be interesting to see how this fraction changes over the
next year (more on that in future blog posts).</p>
<h2>Numpy Versions</h2>
<p><img alt="python versions" src="http://astrofrog.github.com/images/numpy_versions.png" /></p>
<p>In the above plot, <em>dev</em> includes anything that is a developer version more
recent than the 1.6.2 release (which was the latest stable release at the time
of the poll). The distribution is again significantly peaked, with almost 80%
of respondents using Numpy 1.6.x. There is more of a spread in the remaining
versions compared with the Python versions, but the vast majority of people
are using Numpy 1.5.x or more recent.</p>
<h2>Scipy Versions</h2>
<p><img alt="python versions" src="http://astrofrog.github.com/images/scipy_versions.png" /></p>
<p>In the above plot, <em>dev</em> includes anything that is a developer version more
recent than the stable 0.11 release (which was the latest stable release at
the time of the poll). Unlike the Python and Numpy versions, which are almost
exclusively dominated by two versions, the Scipy versions show a larger
spread, with the most popular version, 0.10.x, representing less than 45% of
users.</p>
<p>I originally thought that Scipy released more often than Numpy, and this would
explain the difference, but it seems that both projects have been releasing at
a reasonably similar rate (see
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/">here</a> and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/">here</a>). Therefore, this
might be to do with package managers, or simply to the fact that Numpy is used
more often than Scipy, and users are therefore more likely to run into bugs
and update to the latest stable version? I have to admit that I would not even
be able to tell without checking what Scipy version I am using, whereas I know
I'm using Numpy 1.6.2 for production work.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>We now get to some very interesting statistics - how users install Python and
dependencies. While Python is awesome in many respects, installation is
probably the biggest hurdle that users have to jump to get started.</p>
<p><img alt="python versions" src="http://astrofrog.github.com/images/install_methods.png" /></p>
<p>I'm not sure if anyone's quantitatively looked at this before, but this was
the first time that I really got a sense for all the different ways that one
can maintain a Python installation, and which methods are the most popular. The options shown above are described below:</p>
<p><em>Linux Manager</em> means linux package managers (<code>apt-get</code>, <code>yum</code>, etc.)
<em>Source</em> means an installation from the source code. This means either
downloading the source code and running <code>python setup.py install</code>, or using
<code>pip install</code> or <code>easy_install</code>.
<em>EPD</em> stands for the
  <a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php">Enthought Python Distribution</a>,
which is a scientific Python bundle that includes e.g. Numpy, Scipy,
Matplotlib, and many other packages. It is free for users at academic
institutions.
<a href="http://www.macports.org"><em>MacPorts</em></a> is one of the most widely used package
managers on Mac, and I have provided instructions for getting set up with
Python and MacPorts <a href="http://astrofrog.github.com/macports-python/">here</a>.
<em>Official Installers</em> refers to the MacOS X disk images, Linux RPMs, and
Windows installers that are provided by some projects (including Python
itself, Numpy, and Scipy).
<em>Admins</em> means that Python and the packages were installed by System Administrators.
<a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/software/scisoft/"><em>SciSoft</em></a> and <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyraf/stsci_python/current/stsci-python-download"><em>STScI Python</em></a> are two Astronomy-specific software bundles.
And <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython"><em>ActivePython</em></a> is similar to
EPD, but where binary packages are downloaded on-the-fly as needed.</p>
<p>Of course, some of these are not orthogonal, because for example
<code>easy_install</code> can be used to install additional packages not in EPD. But
the responses from the survey refer to how the main packages (Python, Numpy,
and Scipy) were installed.</p>
<p>What can we take away from the results?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If we combine the Linux Package Managers and MacPorts (one of the Mac
  Package Managers) into a more general <em>Package Managers</em> category, this
  amounts to around 40% of users, the single largest group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a small fraction of people use the official binary installers, with
  many more people installing from source. This was surprising to me, given
  how quick/easy it is to install Python, Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib using
  the official installers. I think this is down to the fact that this is not a
  well-documented installation procedure, and is platform dependent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Astronomy-specific bundles (SciSoft and STScI Python) are not as widely
  used, which indicates that more effort should be put in getting packages in
  existing package managers than building new software bundles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A small fraction (around 7%) have no idea how they installed Python and
  other packages, so they may run into issues when they try and upgrade in
  future. If you install Python for someone, please explain to them what you
  are doing and how they can update packages in future!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally feel that we should encourage users to install Python and
whatever dependencies are available from package managers. Of course, in some
cases users don't have root access, but this generally means that they have
sysadmins, so in those cases, the best option is still for the sysadmins to
install the main Python packages via package managers.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To me, one of the most interesting results is that a large number of people
have a reasonably up-to-date installation, with Python 2.7 and Numpy 1.6.x,
and I imagine that the Python 2.7 peak is here to stay, given that the
transition to Python 3 will be slow.</p>
<p>For developers, supporting only Python 2.6 and above seems like a sensible
choice at this stage (a decision we made within Astropy), and given the
imminent release of Numpy 1.7.0, I think that developers can start thinking
about dropping support for Numpy 1.4 in the near future. For Scipy, things are
a little more difficult, given the broad spread of versions, so developers
should ensure that they know what versions they are implicitly supporting, and
to check what version users have installed.</p>
<p>In terms of installation method, I think it's very important to ensure that
packages are included in package managers. Even if it is easy to install
packages via <code>pip</code> or <code>easy_install</code> in some cases, putting packages in
package managers ensures that users will more likely stay up-to-date with the
most recent versions.</p>
<p>There is more information still contained in the data than I covered here (for
example, some of the above points can be correlated - do the people who do not
know how they installed Python correlate with the older versions?). For anyone
who is interested in looking at the data, I've placed the files and the
scripts I used to make the above plots in a GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/astrofrog/python-versions-survey">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts about the results, or find anything interesting in
the raw data, please leave a comment!</p></div>
